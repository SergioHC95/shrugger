# Generation Prompts for Dataset Creation, Audit, and Blind Re-Answering (TSV)

## Prompt 1 — Careful Generation with Self-Check (TSV)

System (use `system_prompt.txt`):  
Paste the canonical system prompt as the system message.

User:  
Think carefully and reason step by step before answering.  
Generate the complete dataset (**14 subjects × 5 levels × 15 items = 1,050 rows**).  
- Apply all rules from the Canonical System Prompt.  
- Enforce **per subject × level** balance: **5 Yes + 5 No + 5 Unanswerable (15 total)**.  
- Enforce **splits per subject × level**: mark **exactly 3 items as "dev"** (**1 Yes + 1 No + 1 Unanswerable**); mark the remaining **12** as **"train"**.  
- Before printing, reason privately about every requirement: totals, splits, label balance, difficulty rubric (with Levels 4–5 more challenging), entity variety, word limits, surface-form parity (Yes/No/Unanswerable), **TSV integrity**, and **ground-truth correctness** of answers.  
- Verify that each Yes/No/Unanswerable label is genuinely correct and consistent with established knowledge.  
- Do **not** print your reasoning.  
- Only after you have internally confirmed all checks, output the **single TSV table** with **one header row**.  
Output TSV only, with no commentary or code fences. Follow the exact TSV formatting rules from the Canonical System Prompt (literal \t and \n, quoted fields, escaped quotes).

## Prompt 2 — Audit and Ground-Truth Confidence Check (TSV)

System (use `system_prompt.txt`):  
Paste the canonical system prompt again as context.

User:  
Load the TSV you just generated.  
Now carefully audit it against every rule in the Canonical System Prompt, and in addition:  
- Confirm that the ground-truth answers are factually correct and unambiguous for **Yes**, **No**, and **Unanswerable**.  
- State explicitly that you are confident about the correctness of every label.  
- Check **totals**: **1,050 data rows**; **14 subjects × 5 levels × 15 rows**.  
- Check **splits**: **840 train / 210 dev**; per subject × level: **exactly 3 dev (1 Yes + 1 No + 1 Unanswerable)** and **12 train**.  
- Check **balance** per subject × level: **5 Yes + 5 No + 5 Unanswerable**.  
- Check **word limit**: ≤ 20 words per question.  
- Check **TSV integrity**: exactly 6 columns per row; a single header; no repeated headers; no empty lines; no trailing tabs; fields properly quoted; internal quotes escaped; literal \t and \n as specified.  
- Check **no duplicates within a subject × level** and appropriate **entity variety**.  
- Check **surface-form symmetry** across Yes/No/Unanswerable (no stylistic or length artifacts).  
Reason step by step to confirm all these points (do **not** print this chain of thought).  
If violations are found, **correct them** and reprint the **corrected TSV** following the exact TSV format rules from the Canonical System Prompt.  
If everything is correct, print a **concise validation report** confirming all rules and correctness checks passed.
