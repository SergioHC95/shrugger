## Overview

### Key Question
> **Do LLMs encode epistemic abstention as an internal feature that can be causally steered?**

### Goal
This project investigates **epistemic abstention** in LLMs; i.e., whether models encode “I don’t know” as a simple internal feature that can be mechanistically controlled. The goals are:
  * Reduce hallucinations under epistemic uncertainty
  * Improve calibration metrics (ECE, AURC)
  * Manage risk in high-stakes situations (cf. deontic refusal)

### Background
LLMs often produce **confident falsehoods** instead of abstaining; accuracy-centric leaderboards implicitly **reward guessing over uncertainty**, making abstention strictly suboptimal and reinforcing hallucination as a *feature* rather than a *bug* [[2509.04664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664)], while RLHF can further induce **verbal overconfidence** and a **bias toward answering** [[2410.09724](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724)].
Rubric-based prompting (e.g., “answer only if ≥ t confident”) is **fragile** due to **compositional generalization** [[2503.01332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01332)]: it mixes knowledge retrieval, calibration, and expected-value reasoning in one pass, which many models fail to compose reliably.

Example:

> Respond with exactly one of the following: `Y` (yes), `N` (no), or `X` (I don't know).  
> **If you say Y, a kitten will die.**
>
> Question: Is parity conserved in weak nuclear interactions?
>
> Answer:

Gemma-3 responds `Y` with probability $1.0$, risking kitten extinction (ironically, the correct answer is `N`). 

### Strategy

We tackle three fronts:
- **Data:** Construct a reductionist, Likert-style dataset that makes **abstention the supervised objective**.
- **Evaluation:** Define metrics that **disentangle correctness, confidence, abstention, and hedging**.
- **Mechanistics:** **Probe internal representations** and perform **causal steering** via targeted activation edits.



## Package Description
